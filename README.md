## Optimizations

Timed functions with Javascript.

## Lessons Learned:

This was my first project practicing Javascript; I practiced using an event listener by using "onclick" for each specified element. Furthermore, I practiced writing functions as I wrote each click event.  
My next goal would be to refactor my code. Each click event has the same exact syntax and it's repetitive. I could condense the four click events into one, and set the changing element as a parameter.
